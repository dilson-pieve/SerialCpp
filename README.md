## Serial Communication library in C++!

SerialCpp is a C++ header file (.hpp) that allows users to read and write strings to and from an Arduino through a serial port on Windows operating systems. 
To use the library, simply include the header file in a C++ project and utilize the provided functions.

In addition to the header file, the repository includes a directory with examples (`Arduino/`) and a `main.cpp` file to demonstrate how to use the library in a project.

The Windows Serial Communication library was created as a tool to simplify communication between a Windows application and an Arduino through the serial port.</br> 

It is simple and easy to use.
